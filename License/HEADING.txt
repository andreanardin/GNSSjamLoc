GNSSjamLoc is a localization tool for intentional 
interfence sources (jammers), that are potentially disturbing
ligitimate signal reception (e.g. GPS). Given a dataset of power
field measurement associated with spatial coordinates and
distributed over an observation area, GNSSjamLoc can locate the
source of interference, even in complex propagation scenarios (e.g. urban).
It is based on a path loss physics-based model augmented with 
a data-driven component, i.e. a Neural Netrwork.
